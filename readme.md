# Spotify Keep
---

#### SpotifyKeep is an application that lets you backup and save the music you're listening to with the push of a button!

## Why?
I love to listen to new music, and I love to listen to music *while I'm busy doing other things.* The **problem** is that Spotify doesn't give you an easy way to save a song ***without minimizing what you're doing***.

### What are we going to do??
***Install SpotifyKeep!***
* Windows Package - unzip and run SpotifyKeep.exe
    * [32 bit](https://github.com/JBarna/SpotifyKeep/releases/download/1.0.0/SpotifyKeep-win32-ia32.zip)
    * [64 bit](https://github.com/JBarna/SpotifyKeep/releases/download/1.0.0/SpotifyKeep-win32-x64.zip)
* [Mac Package](https://github.com/JBarna/SpotifyKeep/releases/download/1.0.0/SpotifyKeep.zip)

### How to use
* `hotkey` - Press `Alt` and `~` together to save the song you're listening to. Even works if the song is playing from a different source like Sonos!
* `click` - the icon to access options, report issues, quit, and update.

## Wait, there's more!
SpotifyKeep also copies all of your saved songs to a backup playlist named `Keep`. This is for a few reasons:
* `Offline download on desktop` - On computers Spotify only lets you save playlists for offline use, so when your ISP (*cough cough Comcast cough*) screws you, your songs are all saved locally! **You must set the `Keep` playlist to `download for offline use` on the computers you wish to have them.**
* `Safe Keeping` - If you accidently delete your saved songs, you have a backup
* `Share your songs` - Friends can only see playlists, so share all your music by keeping it in `Keep`

*The keep playlist will be created upon first running the application.*

### Run on startup 
* `Windows` - Create a shortcut to `SpotifyKeep.exe`, press `windowskey + r`, enter `shell:startup`, and drop the shortcut there.
* `Mac` - Right click the icon in the application tray, settings -> launch on startup

*This application will continuously update your `Keep` backup playlist even if you saved songs from other devices*
